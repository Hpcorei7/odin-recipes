		<h2>White Lasagna</h2><br>
	
		<h3>The best white lasagna has layers of tender noodles, meaty white 			Bolognese, creamy bechamel and plenty of mozzarella and Parmesan. This 			recipe has it all. You wont miss the tomatoes we promise! We top it all 		off with more cheese, then bake until melty and irresistibly golden brown. 		Serve it alongside a bright, crunchy salad for an impressive, family-			friendly meal.</h3><br>
	
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		
		<ul>
			
			<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

			<li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme</li>

			<li>4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>

			<li>2 stalks celery, finely diced</li>

			<li>1 bay leaf</li>

			<li>1 medium carrot, finely diced</li>

			<li>1 medium onion, finely diced</li>

			<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>

			<li>1 1/2 pounds mild Italian sausage, casings removed</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Steps</h2>
		
		<ul>

			<li>For the white Bolognese: Add the olive oil, thyme, garlic, 				celery, bay leaf, carrot, onion and a good pinch of salt to a 				large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook, stirring 				occasionally and scraping the bottom of the pot with a wooden 				spoon, until the vegetables are completely tender and golden, 				about 15 minutes. (If the vegetables are browning too quickly, 				lower the heat.)</li><br>

			<li>Add the sausage and continue to cook, stirring frequently, 				until the meat is completely broken up and cooked through and most 			of the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon 				salt and several grinds of pepper. Carefully skim the excess fat 			and oil with a spoon and discard.</li><br>

			<li>Add the white wine and cook, stirring occasionally, until 				almost evaporated, 6 to 10 minutes. Add the cream and chicken 				broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring 			occasionally, until the mixture thickens and the flavors come 				together, 30 to 40 minutes. Discard the bay leaf and add salt and 			pepper to taste. Keep warm until ready to assemble.</li><br>
